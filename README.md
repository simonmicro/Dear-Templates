This is a collection of little guides and notes about servers, services, programs and problems - mostly on Linux.
They are designed to give a quick and dirty overview about a topic and some details about setting it up or get a
specific thing running. Sometimes they also include notes about workarounds or tips and tricks - all that good stuff!
What ever you intend to do with them, have fun and make sure to share this repo, if it helped you! ðŸ˜Š

## Contributing ##
You found a mistake, typo or want to improve something? Just do it!

_But please make sure to also update the `summary:`-tag at the head of the modified file accordingly..._

### What is that summary-header at top of every file? ###
This markdown files are written for my website - compiled by Hugo. And because I want to specify an own summary,
I'll need to provide a own header in each file, otherwise a simple Python script is generating the other needed metadata...

## Redistribution ##
Hmmm, yes you can also include this files into e.g. your own Hugo website as e.g. `git submodule`. But please give credit to all the contributors here
and do not claim all this as your own.
