summary: Manage your own email server easily - and how to setup servers to email you. And SPF and stuff...
---

# Install Mailu #
1. Generate the default pair of the `docker-compose.yml` and `mailu.env` files [here](https://setup.mailu.io/1.7/) - here some notes:
    * DO NOT USE IPv6 -> THIS CAUSES AN OPEN RELAY - REGARDLESS OF THE CONFIGURATION (see issue [here](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1578))
    * With DB (sqlite can be very slown with bigger systems) - why not?
    * Enable the Rainloop-webmail it is needed for sieve script editing (Mailu cant expose the sieve ports currently)
2. Add the initial administrator account with `docker-compose exec admin flask mailu admin USERNAME DOMAIN PASSWORD` (the email for the admin will be `USERNAME@DOMAIN`)
3. Disabled the POP3 ports and allowed them to listen on `0.0.0.0` - note I don't use ipv6 here!
4. Added a user forward wildcard (`%` - SQL syntax) to point to some account, this hides the known users on the system (no rejecting)
5. Maybe use relay hosts (authenticated SMTP is also supported) - otherwise your private ip address can lock you from some email providers out -> see https://mailu.io/master/configuration.html
6. Add the following to the webmail section inside the compose file to unlock the custom sieve script button inside the webmail (from [here](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1452)):
    ```
    command: ["bash", "-c", 'sed -i "/^sieve_allow_raw/s/=.*/= On/" /default.ini; /start.py']
    ```

# Configure Postfix and Servers #
Why Postfix? Because it is dead simple and we don't need any SMTP authentication for the trusted servers here...
1. Installed postfix
    * Satellite system
    * Relay host is the hostname of the Mailu server (make sure to use IPv4 when you enter a static ip address here)
2. Change `/etc/aliases` to point `root` to e.g. your user and your user to any email on the Mailu server
3. Apply the changes with `sudo newaliases`
4. Change inside `/etc/postfix/main.cf` file the `myhostname` to something like `hostname.localdomain` to fix sender-address rejected (when you add a FQDN there, Mailu **WILL NOT REWRITE** domains to the servers hostname anymore -> in that case just add the systems hostname) - this can sometimes still fail. In that case allow the affected server ips as relay networks without authentication inside the `mailu.env` file (private ipv4s are not routed, therefore OK)...
5. Add DKIM, SPF and DMARC - this way you can make sure nobody could impersonate your domains email server (how it works see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEpU-iqBerI))!
6. Make it more secure (we don't need to forward emails from outside to our smtp server for which we are may whitelisted) - comment inside `/etc/postfix/master.cf` the following line:
    ```
    smtp      inet  n       -       y       -       -       smtpd
    ```

# Setup Fail2Ban
**WARNING** This blocks any bad behaving IP **for all** Docker services on that host! Think twice if you really want that...

Well, Mailu already comes with its own rate limits, but sadly it also counts successful logins against it. When you have, at some point, multiple accounts for one user, this particular user may get blocked by the server regulary. Thats very unhelpful! To fix that, lets switch to Fail2Ban!
1. Extend the `docker-compose.yml` for the `front` container:
    ```yaml
        logging:
            driver: journald
    ```
2. Install the `fail2ban` package on your host and create the following files with their content:
* `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/docker-mailu.conf`
    ```ini
    # Fail2Ban configuration file
    [Definition]
    failregex = .* client login failed: .+ client:\ <HOST>
    ignoreregex =
    ```
* `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/docker-mailu.conf`
    ```ini
    [docker-mailu]
    enabled = true
    filter = docker-mailu
    logpath = /var/log/syslog
    bantime = 604800
    findtime = 300
    maxretry = 5
    action = docker-action
    # You should not just ignore the following line. Think twice if you really do not want to exclude _something_... Like your own VPN-Gateway? Or own subnet?
    # ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/24 127.0.42.1/24
    ```
* `/etc/fail2ban/action.d/docker-action.conf`
    ```ini
    [Definition]
    actioncheck = iptables -n -L DOCKER-USER | grep -q 'DOCKER-USER[ \t]'

    actionban = iptables -I DOCKER-USER -s <ip> -j DROP

    actionunban = iptables -D DOCKER-USER -s <ip> -j DROP
    ```
3. Restart fail2ban and watch the logs of it for the ips, which gets blocked (for more stuff checkout the fail2ban template!)...
4. Make sure to increase your auth limits inside the `.env` file, so fail2ban can work (and you wont get any further problems with it)! Example:
    ```bash
    # Authentication rate limit (per source IP address)
    # IS NOW SECURED BY FAIL2BAN -> DISABLED WITH VERY HIGH LIMITS!
    AUTH_RATELIMIT=1000/minute;10000/hour
    ```

## Notes ##
* In case of errors with postfix: `sudo tail -f /var/log/mail.*`
* If you ever need the install configure assistant again: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix` (this will overwrite your changes to any local config file!)
* If you want to use postfix on the docker host itself, it will need an other port to talk to the front container of Mailu - add a port like this (instead of 25) -> `127.0.0.1:11823:25`. Otherwise postfix will think it would use itself to deliver emails - therefore block any email...
* Got some problems like [that](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1364)? Add into your mailu path `./mailu/overrides/dovecot.conf` with:
    ```
    protocol imap {
        mail_max_userip_connections = 100
    }
    ```
* You need to flush the queue? Run `postqueue -f` to resend them immediately!
