# VIRTUAL MACHINE #

## VM - Bind to a VLAN-tagged intreface ##
1. Create the tagged interface(s - here `42` and `44` for example on `eno1`) on the hosts network configuration `/etc/network/interfaces` - in this example we'll only dhcp on the untagged/parent interface (you could dhcp on them all, but this will confuse your dhcp as the same mac is used everywhere):
    ```
    allow-hotplug eno1
    iface eno1 inet dhcp

    auto eno1.42
    iface eno1.42 inet manual

    auto eno1.44
    iface eno1.44 inet manual
    ```
2. Reconnect your virt-manager and the new virtual interface should be there to bridge into.

## VM - Allow multicast packages ##
_Multicast packages are generated by e.g. the avahi daemon or minidlna and is neccessary to use the avahi zeroconf service (needed for media streaming etc)._
1. Show all running vms: `sudo virsh list`
2. Edit the xml file of the machine, which _should_ be allowed to send out these packages: `sudo virsh edit X`
3. Go down to the network interface which should be allowed (e.g. NOT the [LOCALSTORAGENET]) to do that and change the following code
    ```xml
    <devices>
    ...
    <interface type='XXX'>
    ...
    </interface>
    ...
    </devices>
    ```
    to
    ```xml
    <devices>
    ...
    <interface type='XXX' trustGuestRxFilters='yes'>
    ...
    </interface>
    ...
    </devices>
    ```
4. Cold-boot the vm.

## VM - Enable TRIM to save image space ##
This frees the unsuded space inside a vm also on disk. This may accelerates fragmentation, but on `zfs` it will take quite some time until that happens.
_The steps 1-2 are only needed for vm created before qemu v4.0!_

1. Change disk type to "SCSI" **and** set `discard="unmap"`
2. Change the controller type to "VirtIO SCSI" (`virtio-scsi`)
3. Enable the trim service inside the vm (on older versions of Debian first run `sudo cp /usr/share/doc/util-linux/examples/fstrim.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system`):
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
    sudo systemctl start fstrim.timer
    sudo fstrim -av
    ```
    _The last command just trims the ssd/disks for the first time._
4. Cold-boot the vm.

When the `fstrim` command exits _too fast_ check with `sudo lsblk -o MOUNTPOINT,DISC-MAX,FSTYPE` for any `0B` entries - in that case that disk does not support
TRIM -> you have done something wrong. Also you may want to check with `du -h [DISK_IMAGE]` the really used space for the images (they should shrink during the first `fstrim`)...

## Watchdog & Panic Notifier ##
Libvirt has a watchdog feature, which can e.g. reboot a vm on crash - other than the "panic notifier" device, which just powers the vm down. How to setup the watchdog:
1. Add the Watchdog device into the vm
2. Inside the vm:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install watchdog
    sudo systemctl enable watchdog
    ```
3. Enable the device inside the service config `/etc/watchdog.conf`:
    ```ini
    watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog
    realtime        = yes
    priority        = 1
    ```
4. Cold-Boot the vm. If you ever wich to test the watchdog, you may crash the kernel with `sync; echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger` as `root`!

## [VM - Install windows support here](https://www.spice-space.org/download.html) ##

# SERVER #

## Setup ##
1. `sudo apt install libvirt-daemon libvirt-bin qemu-kvm qemu-utils`
2. `sudo apt install ebtables firewalld dnsmasq`

## Setup (Debian Jessie+) ##
The first command should be:
`sudo apt install libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients qemu-kvm qemu-utils`

## Support guest UEFI ##
`sudo apt install ovmf`

## Allow a user to control the kvm ##
1. `sudo addgroup [USER] kvm`
2. `sudo addgroup [USER] libvirt`

## Firewalld - MAKE SURE TO FIX THAT BUG (if neccessary) ###
Add/Replace this to `/etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf`
```ini
CleanupOnExit=no
```
_Otherwise a reboot could take up to several minutes!_

### Useful commands for firewalld ###
* Configure:
    * `sudo firewall-cmd --state`
    * `firewall-cmd --get-active-zones`
* What default zones is active? `firewall-cmd --get-default-zone`
* What zones is active on...? `firewall-cmd --get-zone-of-interface [INTERFACE_NAME]`
* List all services which are known: `firewall-cmd --get-services`
* Add a service for an zone: `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=[SERVICE_NAME] --zone=[ZONE_NAME]`
* Add a port for an zone: `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=[PORT]/tcp --zone=[ZONE_NAME]`
* Disable firewall COMPLETLY for an interface: `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --change-interface=[INTERFACE_NAME]`
* Disable firewall COMPLETLY for ALL interfaces (permanently only): `sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=trusted`

## Enable automatic freezing of guests at host reboot ##
This are the needed files & scripts:

* Service file `vmfreezer.service`
    ```systemd
    [Unit]
    Description=VMFreezer - saves / restores all running machines of libvirt from / to disk
    Requires=libvirtd.service
    #libvirt-guests.service is in after, because @shutdown this order is inverse!
    #Add here the required path (maybe to save the states on external disks) from /etc/fstab (slash must be a dash)
    #MAYBE add mnt-raid01.mount to wait for a specific mount point...
    After=network.service libvirtd.service libvirt-guests.service
    #Before=

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    #infinity -> make sure we wait for ANY vm!
    TimeoutSec=infinity
    RemainAfterExit=true
    ExecStart=/root/restore.sh
    ExecStop=/root/save.sh

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
* Restore script to `restore.sh`
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Restore all guests from saved state and start

    cd /mnt/
    echo "Working in `pwd`."
    ls -1 *.state | \
    while read GUEST; do
        echo "Restoring $GUEST..."
        virsh restore $GUEST --running
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Removing the old state $GUEST..."
            rm $GUEST
        else
            echo "Start of $GUEST failed. The state will be moved to /tmp/ - so it can manually restored... Eventually..."
            mv $GUEST /tmp/
        fi
        # Now sleep a short period of time to make sure, that e.g. dynamic memory has been populated properly...
        sleep 5
    done
    ```
* Restore script to `save.sh`
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Save (store ram and shutdown) all guests

    cd /mnt/
    echo "Working in `pwd`."
    virsh list | `#list of running guest` \
    tail -n +3 | head -n -1 | sed 's/\ \+/\t/g' | `#strip head and tail, use tab for seperator`\
    awk '{print($2)}' | \
    while read GUEST; do
        echo "Saving $GUEST..."
        virsh save $GUEST $GUEST.state
    done
    ```

**Make sure to modify the `cd` command to fit your wanted save-state-location!**

### Install the vmfreezer service ###
1. Add the `vmfreezer.service` file to `/etc/systemd/system`
2. Add the `save.sh` file to `/root`
3. Add the `restore.sh` file to `/root`
4. Set permissons for them `sudo chmod 500 /root/save.sh /root/restore.sh`
5. ↑ DON'T FORGET to modify the scripts to use the correct path to save and restore the vms! Also this service won't be able to (re-)store any vm, which does not support saving anyways (e.g. the ones with shared-folders or UEFI)!
6. Enable the new service with `sudo systemctl enable vmfreezer`

## Set static IPs for the VMs ##
...inside any isolated network, hosted by the host itself - just modify the respective network config with `sudo virsh net-edit [LOCALSTORAGENET_NAME]` and add:
```xml
<network>
...
<dhcp>
...
<host mac='52:54:00:6c:3c:01' name='vm1' ip='192.168.122.11'/>
<host mac='52:54:00:6c:3c:02' name='vm2' ip='192.168.122.12'/>
...
</dhcp>
...
</network>
```

## Shared folders ##
Some performance-notes out of the real world:
* NFS is fast, but is more complex to manage as it is IP authentication based (or you get Kerberos somehow working) 
* Samba works, but it is complicated to setup any new user as always a corresponding system user is needed... Also special characters break things...
* P9 just works, but is always slow (small package size -> good directory listing, but bandwith limit by cpu performance; big package size -> painfully slow directoy listing, but good bandwith) - also the caching is funny. Also special characters break things...

### NFS with ZFS ###
Make sure (on both client and server) that NFS ist installed already:
```bash
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
```
Also make sure to use for the `[SEVRER_IP]` a ip, which does not utilizes any bridged interface between guest and host. This won't work!

#### Server: Share creation ####
Enable pool export:
```bash
sudo zfs set sharenfs=on [POOL_NAME]
```
Instead of a simple `on` you could also pass any [NFS option](https://linux.die.net/man/5/exports) to it - here some examples:
* `rw`/`ro`: Set the write mode - append e.g. `=@192.168.0.1` or `=@192.168.0.1/24` to restrict it to specific clients/networks
* `root_squash`*/`no_root_squash`: Should the root uid remapped to an anonymous request? Needed when `chown` should work...
* `all_squash`/`no_all_squash`*: Should every client uid remapped to ↓?
* `anonuid` & `anongid`: Set the remapping target uid/gui (defaults to the user `nobody`)
`*` -> Default!

#### Client: Mount it! ####
After exporting the dataset on the server, query the exact name on the clients by using:
```bash
showmount --exports [SERVER_IP]
```
Then you can mount it for testing purposes directly with:
```bash
sudo mount -t nfs [SERVER_IP]:[ZFS_EXPORT_PATH] [TARGET_PATH]
```
You may add it into the `/etc/fstab`:
```
[SERVER_IP]:[ZFS_EXPORT_PATH] [TARGET_PATH]  nfs      defaults    0       0
```
Also here an interesting [NFS option](https://linux.die.net/man/5/nfs):
* `soft`/`hard`: When hard NFS will retry the connection forever when it fails (freezes the application triggering it; NFS defaults to hard!)

### KVM (P9) ###
Just add a new mapped shared folder with a new [TARGET_PATH].
To mount it, just insert following line into the guests `/etc/fstab`:
```
[TARGET_PATH]    [LOCAL_PATH]       9p      trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,msize=262144    0       0
```
IF you get emergency boot failures - insert the following into `/etc/initramfs-tools/modules`:
```
9p
9pnet
9pnet_virtio
```
...and update `sudo update-initramfs -u`!

If the listing of much files is too slow, try enabling the cache ([copied from here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/9p.txt)):
```
cache=mode	specifies a caching policy.  By default, no caches are used.
        none = default no cache policy, metadata and data
                alike are synchronous.
        loose = no attempts are made at consistency,
                intended for exclusive, read-only mounts
        fscache = use FS-Cache for a persistent, read-only
	            cache backend.
        mmap = minimal cache that is only used for read-write
                mmap.  Northing else is cached, like cache=none
```

### Samba (CIFS) ###
#### Install server... ####
`sudo apt install samba`

#### Add a virtual isolated network for loopback communication with the host and vm ####
* Make sure to enable DHCP, so the host will listen to the clients (instead being REALLY isolated).
* Add this interface (e.g. virbr1) to the firewall (trusted zone is okay - because the VMs should have a second interface anyway which is in the same network like the host)...
* _Note that the host can contact the VMs ONLY using that networks IPs from this network!_
* **Because the host is _always faster_ than the other network interfaces you REALLY SHOULD apply the following fix:**
    1. Use the command `sudo virsh net-edit [LOCALSTORAGENET_NAME]` to open the xml-configuration-file of the virtual network.
    2. Add there the following code (if you add any other entry than the one domain=... the host will resolve the request for the client - so don't be confused if the /etc/resolv.conf specifies then the host as dns provider)...
        ```xml
        <network>
        ...
        <dns>
        <forwarder domain='router.domain'/>
        <forwarder addr='1.1.1.1'/>
        </dns>
        ...
        </network>
        ```
        ...to forward any request to either the real network dns provider or e.g. Cloudflare!
    3. Save it, restart the network and reboot any vms to apply the fix!

#### Setup the smb.conf to... ####
```ini
#THIS ALL REQUIRES samba
#This is lacated at /etc/samba/smb.conf

[global]
#Network stuff
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = %h
#Following: Set it to the servers local IP (the one from virbr1 / localhost)
#hosts allow = localhost 127.0.0.1 192.168.0.0/24
#hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0
dns proxy = no
disable netbios = yes
name resolve order = bcast host

#Permissions USE sudo smbpasswd -a USER to add user, USE sudo smbpasswd -x USER to remove user
guest account = nobody
security = user
encrypt passwords = true
invalid users = root
guest ok = no

#Stuff
unix extensions = yes
unix password sync = no
usershare owner only = yes
#Log size in Kb
max log size = 50

#Server role inside the network
server role = standalone server

#Fix the permissions to allow group access!
#force user = [USER (Only if neccessary)]
force group = [FSgroup]
#Following seems to be useless with the following fixes...
#create mask = 770
#FIX permission: File: UPPER bound for the bits
create mode = 770
#FIX permission: File: LOWER bound for the bits
force create mode = 770
#FIX permission: Directory: UPPER bound for the bits
directory mode = 770
#FIX permission: Directory: LOWER bound for the bits
force directory mode = 770

#
#NOTE:
#browseable = no -> Hidden share
#

[Share1]
    path = [PATH]
    available = yes
    #Following to hide it anyways!
    browseable = no
    guest ok = no
    #Following to make read only if no user is in the write list!
    writeable = no
    valid users = [VirtUsers]
    write list = [VirtUsers]
```

### VM - Allow a vm access to a specific share... ####
Nett2Know: Use `sudo pdbedit -L` to get current user list...
1. Add an account on the host (nologin, nohome) with `sudo adduser --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin --disabled-login [USER]`
2. Add this account to the FSgroup `sudo adduser [USER] [FSgroup]`
3. Allow samba to map to this account (now is a good PWD neccessary) `sudo smbpasswd -a [USER]`
4. Add the account to the shares at the smb.conf
5. Add the share to the vm and save the credentials there (next paragraph)

### Setup a vm to access and mount a specific share ###
Add this to fstab (it will mount on first access - this is neccessary, because some (...) systemd instances ignore the \_netdev option) `//[HOST_LOCALSTORAGENET_IP]/[SHARE_NAME]  [TARGET_PATH]	cifs noauto,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.idle-timeout=5m,_netdev,nouser,mapchars,cache=strict,noacl,credentials=[CREDENTIAL_FILE (e.g. /root/creds)],domain=workgroup,uid=root,gid=[VM_SHARED_FOLDER_GROUP],file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770 0   0`
_On cd-failures with error -13 you fucked up the password or username!_
_Use cache=strict to fix ghosting folders (if they still appear use 'none' - BUT THIS WILL IMPACT PERFORMACE). When there are no ghosting folders or files you can try to use 'loose' to further improve performance._

### Setup a vm to make shares available (needed only ONCE)... ###
1. Install cifs `sudo apt install cifs-utils`
2. Add the host localstorage interface to /etc/network/interfaces: `iface [INTERFACE_NAME] inet dhcp`
3. Add a group for the shares `sudo addgroup [VM_SHARED_FOLDER_GROUP]`
4. Add a user to this group `sudo addgroup [USER (e.g. www-data)] [VM_SHARED_FOLDER_GROUP]`
5. Create the authentication file (e.g. /root/creds):
    ```
    username=[USERNAME]
    password=[PASSWORD]
    ```
6. Set permissons for the credential file `sudo chmod 500 [CREDENTIAL_FILE (e.g. /root/creds)]`

# CLIENT(S) #

## Setup management-client ##
```bash
sudo apt install virt-manager spice-client-gtk gir1.2-spiceclientgtk-3.0
```

## Setup viewonly-client ##
```bash
sudo apt install virt-viewer
```
